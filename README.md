# Rock_paper_scissor

This code is the game Rock-Paper-Scissors in C. It allows the player to play the game against the computer, allowing the player to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors

Here is a breakdown of how the law works.

1. The `Rock_paper_Scissor` function is defined to implement game logic. It runs a hammer through the game until the player decides to quit.

2. In the loop:
   - The game options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) are displayed, and the player's choice is taken as input.
   - Computer selection is randomly generated by `rand() % 3 + 1`.
   - The selected computer is displayed.

3. The outcome of the game depends on the choices of the player and his teammates. The results of the game are presented according to rock-paper-cheating rules.

4. After each game, the players were asked if they wanted to play again. If the player chooses 'y' or 'Y', the loop continues for another round. If another line is selected, the loop breaks and the operation ends.

5. The `main` function simply calls the `Rock_paper_Scissor` function to start the game.

Itâ€™s important to note that there are a few problems with the rule:
- The variable `computer` is assigned the value 0 but is not used anywhere in the code.
- The function `rand()` from the `<stdlib.h>` library is used to generate random numbers, but the code does not generate a random number generator using `srand()` before calling `rand()`, a it can generate predictable random numbers. You should use `srand(time(NULL))` to seed the random number generator, where `time(NULL)` gives a slightly random result based on the current time.
- The function `main` must have a return type of `int` and return an integer value to identify the function from state. A return value of 0 is used to indicate a successful execution of the program.
